# Copyright

## The original copyright notice

Xpdf is copyright 1996-2007 Derek B. Noonburg.

Xpdf is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL), version
2.  In my opinion, the GPL is a convoluted, confusing, ambiguous mess.
But it's also pervasive, and I'm sick of arguing.  And even if it is
confusing, the basic idea is good.

In order to cut down on the confusion a little bit, here are some
informal clarifications:

- I don't mind if you redistribute xpdf in source and/or binary form,
  as long as you include all of the documentation: README, man pages
  (or help files), and COPYING.  (Note that the README file contains a
  pointer to a web page with the source code.)

- Selling a CD-ROM that contains xpdf is fine with me, as long as it
  includes the documentation.  I wouldn't mind receiving a sample
  copy, but it's not necessary.

- If you make useful changes to xpdf, please make the source code
  available -- post it on a web site, email it to me, whatever.
